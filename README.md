# LinearRegression-Scratch

## About
This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy. It is divided into two sections:

- **SLR (Simple Linear Regression)**: Covers the implementation of linear regression with a single feature.
- **MLR (Multiple Linear Regression)**: Explores linear regression with multiple features.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a fundamental understanding of how linear regression works under the hood, without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn.

## Prerequisites
To run the notebooks, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhd-Uwais/LinearRegression-Scratch.git
   cd LinearRegression-Scratch
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Navigate to `SLR/slr.ipynb` or `MLR/mlr.ipynb` and run the code cells.
