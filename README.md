# LinearRegression-Scratch

## About
This repository contains an implementation of **Linear Regression from scratch** using Python and NumPy. It is divided into two sections:

- **SLR (Simple Linear Regression)**: Covers the implementation of linear regression with a single feature.
- **MLR (Multiple Linear Regression)**: Explores linear regression with multiple features.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a **fundamental understanding** of how linear regression works under the hood, without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn. By implementing it from scratch, you will gain insights into the mathematical principles and computational steps involved.
